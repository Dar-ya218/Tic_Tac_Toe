# 🎮 The Best Tic Tac Toe Ever!

## What's This Madness?
Ever thought regular Tic Tac Toe was too... boring? Too... normal? Well, hold onto your keyboards because this version comes with more drama than a soap opera! 

## ✨ Features That Will Change Your Life (or at least the next 5 minutes)
- 🎭 X's and O's with personality disorders
- 🎪 A board that judges your every move
- 🌟 Sarcastic commentary that would make your grandma proud
- 🎨 ASCII art that would make da Vinci question his career choice
- 🎵 More drama than your favorite reality TV show

## 🚀 How to Join This Circus
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open your terminal (that black screen that makes you feel like a hacker)
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```
   (Warning: May cause excessive eye-rolling and uncontrollable giggling)

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Victory
- The goal is to get three in a row (shocking, I know)
- X's go first (because they're divas like that)
- O's go second (they're used to being second choice)
- Diagonal lines count (mind = blown)
- If you lose to the computer, it's definitely rigged (or so you can tell yourself)

## ⚠️ Side Effects May Include
- Sudden urges to draw X's and O's everywhere
- Developing a rivalry with inanimate objects
- Taking way too long to decide which corner is best
- Questioning life choices when losing to random moves
- Excessive celebration for winning at a children's game
